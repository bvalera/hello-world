Just another repository 

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

Finished working on the implementation of a WLAN using SDN (Software Defined Networking) for 5G Networks. 

Currently studying a Master degree in Telecommunications Engineering. My research interests include SDN and 4G and 5G wireless systems, among others.
